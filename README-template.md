### Useful resources

- [How to download jQuery YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6Q7xY25loA) - I was intitially having issues using jQueries within my script.js file and noticed an error within terminal. So, I found this video helpful as I did not know I needed to download a file for jQueries nor did I know how to add it to my code.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_css.asp) - This webpage helped me understand how I can put jQueries into practice for events such as click events.
- [Media Queries Alternative YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYW3O0AxpI8) - This video helped me understand a more efficient alternative to media queries such as using min(), max(), and clamp(). I used clamp throughout my css stylesheet to avoid using multiple media queries.
